            ## 🚀 Project Structure

            Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

            ```
            /
            ├── public/
            │   ├── robots.txt
            │   └── favicon.ico
            ├── src/
            │   ├── components/
            │   │   └── Tour.astro
            │   └── pages/
            │       └── index.astro
            └── package.json
            ```

            Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory.
            Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

            There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

            Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
